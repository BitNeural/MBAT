## Getting Started
To run the Mbat locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Truffle Suite
- MetaMask or other Ethereum wallet extension for your browser

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.

### Deploying the Contracts
1. Deploy the smart contracts to a local development blockchain using Truffle. Run `truffle migrate --reset` to deploy the contracts.
2. Note the contract addresses and update the frontend configuration accordingly.

## Smart Contracts
The following smart contracts are the backbone of our Mbat.

### UserIdentity
The UserIdentity contract stores verified user identities and related information, including full name, date of birth, nationality, and contact details.

### UserProfile
The UserProfile contract allows users to create and manage their profiles. Users can store their name, email, and profile photo on IPFS.

### UserVerification
The UserVerification contract manages user consents and authorizations. It provides functions for users to grant and revoke access to their identity data by authorized entities.

### MobileBioAuthToken
The MobileBioAuthToken contract implements the ERC-20 token standard. It serves as the platform's utility token for transactions and staking.

### Staking
The Staking contract enables users to stake their tokens and earn rewards based on predefined vesting schedules.

### Marketplace
The Marketplace contract allows users to buy and sell goods or services using the platform's utility token.

### BiometricVerifier
The BiometricVerifier contract performs biometric verification checks for users. It is integrated with the Mbat to verify user identities using various biometric data.

### SocialNetworkIdentification
The SocialNetworkIdentification contract links users to their social network accounts, providing additional verification options.

## Frontend
Our Mbat has a user-friendly frontend for interacting with the smart contracts.

### User Interface
The frontend provides an intuitive user interface to access the Mbat's features, including identity verification, profile creation, and token staking.

### Authentication
Users can connect their Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to the Mbat to authenticate and sign transactions securely.

### Interacting with Smart Contracts
The frontend allows users to interact with the smart contracts seamlessly. Users can verify their identity, create and manage profiles, stake tokens, and participate in the token marketplace.

## Deployment
To deploy the Mbat to testnet or mainnet, follow the steps below.

### Testing
Use Truffle and JavaScript test scripts to perform contract testing before deployment. Run `truffle test` to execute the tests.

### Deploying to Testnet or Mainnet
1. Update the truffle configuration file with your desired network settings (e.g., network URL, gas price, and gas limit).
2. Run `truffle migrate --network <network_name>` to deploy the contracts to the desired network.

## Security
The security of our Mbat is of utmost importance.

### Best Practices
We follow industry best practices for smart contract development, including secure coding and avoiding common vulnerabilities.

### Security Audit
Our smart contracts have undergone a third-party security audit. Please refer to the audit report for details.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to our project. Please follow the guidelines outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Decentralized Identity Verification and Token Staking Platform
Overview
Our decentralized application (Mbat) introduces a novel approach to decentralized identity verification and token staking. We leverage the power of blockchain technology to create a secure and user-centric platform that ensures users' identities are verified in a privacy-preserving manner. The platform also offers token staking features to incentivize user participation and foster a vibrant ecosystem.

Traditionally, identity verification processes involve centralized authorities and third-party intermediaries, leading to concerns about data privacy, security breaches, and lack of user control. Our Mbat addresses these challenges by utilizing decentralized identity verification and storage mechanisms, enhancing data privacy, and putting users in control of their personal information.

Novel Approach
Decentralized Identity Verification
Our Mbat's uniqueness lies in its decentralized identity verification process, which incorporates cutting-edge biometric verification and cryptographic proofs. The UserIdentity contract serves as the core component, securely storing users' verified identities and associated information. The BiometricVerifier contract performs sophisticated biometric checks, ensuring users' biometric data remains on-chain while maintaining privacy and security.

Additionally, the SocialNetworkIdentification contract introduces an innovative method for linking users to their social network accounts, further enhancing identity verification options. By combining various verification techniques, we create a robust and adaptable identity verification system that can be tailored to diverse user needs.

User-Centric Profile Management
The UserProfile contract allows users to create and manage their profiles within the Mbat. Users can store their personal information, such as name, email, and profile photo, on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This approach ensures that user data remains decentralized and immutable while granting users full control over their profiles.

Secure User Consent Management
The UserVerification contract introduces a user consent management system, empowering users to grant or revoke access to their identity data by authorized entities. This consent-driven approach enhances data privacy and aligns with the principles of decentralized governance.

Innovative Token Staking Mechanism
Our MBAT offers a novel token staking mechanism through the Staking contract. Users can stake their tokens and earn rewards based on predefined vesting schedules. This incentivizes token holders to participate actively, foster community engagement, and contribute to the platform's growth.

Marketplace Integration
The Marketplace contract enables users to transact using the platform's utility token, MobileBioAuthToken (MBAT). Users can buy and sell goods or services within the Mbat's marketplace, creating a vibrant economy supported by the utility token.

Benefits
Enhanced Data Privacy: Our MBAT eliminates the need for users to share sensitive identity information with centralized entities, minimizing the risk of data breaches.
User-Controlled Identity: Users maintain full control over their verified identities and can selectively share data with authorized entities.
Decentralized Governance: The user consent management system fosters decentralized governance and aligns with the principles of user sovereignty.
Seamless User Experience: The user-friendly frontend facilitates easy interaction with smart contracts, making the Mbat accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.
Incentivized Participation: Token staking and rewards incentivize active user participation, contributing to a thriving and engaged user community.
Interoperability: Our approach aligns with emerging standards for decentralized identity verification and can integrate with other blockchain-based identity solutions.
Future Enhancements
As our Mbat evolves, we plan to implement the following enhancements:

Integration with additional biometric verification methods, enabling users to choose from a broader range of verification options.
Advanced behavioral biometrics, such as facial recognition data recording, to enhance identity verification accuracy.
Expansion of the marketplace, supporting a wider array of goods and services to cater to user preferences.
Cross-chain interoperability, enabling users to leverage their identities and tokens across multiple blockchain networks.
